## Introduction

Evaluating the extent to which a digital product conforms to the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) is a process involving several steps. The activities carried out within these steps are influenced by many aspects such as: the type of digital products (e.g. website, mobile application, kiosk, document, etc.); its size, complexity, and the technologies used to create the digital product (e.g. HTML, WAI-ARIA, PDF, etc.); how much knowledge the evaluators have about the process used to design and develop the digital product; and the main purpose for the evaluation (e.g. to issue an accessibility statement, to plan a redesign process, to perform research, etc.).

This methodology describes the steps that are common to processes for comprehensive evaluation of the extent of conformance of digital product to WCAG 2. It highlights considerations for evaluators to apply these steps in the context of a particular digital product. It does not replace the need for quality assurance measures that are implemented throughout the design, development, and maintenance of digital products to ensure their accessibility conformance. Following this methodology will help evaluators apply good practice, avoid commonly made mistakes, and achieve more comparable results. However, in the majority of situations using this methodology alone, without additional quality assurance measures, does not directly result in WCAG 2 conformance claims.

**This methodology does not in any way add to or change the requirements defined by the normative WCAG 2 standard**, nor does it provide instructions on feature by feature evaluation of web content. The methodology can be used in conjunction with techniques for meeting WCAG 2 success criteria, such as the [Techniques for WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/) documented by W3C/WAI, but does not require this or any other specific set of techniques.
