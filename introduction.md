## Introduction

This document describes a process to comprehensively evaluate whether a digital product conforms to the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/). 

Accessibility evaluations of digital products can be necessary in many situations, such as before releasing, acquiring, or redesigning the product, and for periodic monitoring of the accessibility performance of a product over time.

Several factors can impact an evaluation: 

- the type of digital product (e.g. website, mobile application, kiosk, document, etc.); 
- its size, its complexity, and which technologies it uses (e.g. HTML, WAI-ARIA, PDF, etc.); 
- how much knowledge the evaluators have how the product was designed and developed;
- the main purpose for the evaluation (e.g. to issue an accessibility statement, to plan a redesign process, to perform research, etc.)

This document takes these factors into account and highlights several considerations for evaluators. It provides a common framework for accessibility evaluations, to help apply good practice, avoid commonly made mistakes, and achieve more comparable results.

This document does not replace the need for quality assurance throughout all phases of product development. **It also does not in any way add to or change the requirements defined by the normative WCAG 2 standard**, nor does it provide instructions on feature by feature evaluation of web content. The methodology can be used together with techniques to meet WCAG 2 success criteria, such as the [Techniques for WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/), but does not require this or any other specific set of techniques.
