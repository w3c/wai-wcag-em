## Introduction

This document describes a process to comprehensively evaluate whether a digital product conforms to [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/). 

Accessibility evaluations of digital products can be necessary in many situations, such as before releasing, acquiring, or redesigning a product, and for periodic monitoring of the accessibility performance of a product over time.

Several factors can impact an evaluation, including the: 

- type of digital product (for example, website, mobile application, kiosk, document),
- size of a digital product, its complexity, and which technologies it uses (for example, HTML, WAI-ARIA, PDF),
- degree of knowledge the evaluators have about how the product was designed and developed, and
- main purpose for the evaluation (for example, to issue an accessibility statement, to plan a redesign process, to perform research).

This document takes these factors into account and highlights several considerations for evaluators. It provides a common framework for accessibility evaluations that acts as a roadmap, helping evaluators apply good practice, avoid commonly made mistakes, and achieve more comparable results.

This document does not replace the need for quality assurance throughout all phases of product development. **It also does not in any way add to or change the requirements defined by the normative WCAG 2 standard**, nor does it provide instructions on feature-by-feature evaluation of web content. The methodology can be used together with techniques to meet WCAG 2 success criteria, such as the [Techniques for WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/), but does not require this or any other specific set of techniques.
