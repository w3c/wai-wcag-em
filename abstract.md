This document describes a procedure to evaluate how well digital services and products conform to the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/). 

It provides technology-agnostic guidance on defining the evaluation scope, exploring the target product, selecting representative samples from products, auditing the selected samples, and reporting the evaluation findings. It is suitable for use in different evaluation contexts, including self-assessment and third-party evaluation. 

This document does not define feature-specific instructions, as the WCAG Success Criteria and [supporting documents](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/docs/) cover those. It also does not define additional WCAG 2 requirements, nor does it replace or supersede them in any way.
