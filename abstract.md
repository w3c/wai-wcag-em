This document describes a procedure to evaluate how well digital products conform to the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/). 

It provides technology-agnostic guidance to define the evaluation scope, explore the target product, select a representative [sample set](#sampleset) from products, evaluate the selected [sample set](#sampleset), and report the evaluation findings. This procedure is suitable for use in different evaluation contexts, including self-assessment and third-party evaluation. 

This document does not define feature-specific instructions, as the WCAG Success Criteria and [supporting documents](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/docs/) cover those. It also does not define additional WCAG 2 requirements, nor does it replace or supersede them in any way.
