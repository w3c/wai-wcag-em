## Using This Methodology

This methodology is used for thorough evaluation of digital products using WCAG 2. Before evaluating an entire digital product it is usually good to do a preliminary evaluation of different web pages from the target product to identify obvious accessibility barriers and develop an overall understanding of the accessibility of the digital product. [Easy Checks - A First Review of Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/preliminary/) describes such an approach for preliminary evaluation that is complementary to this methodology.

### Required Expertise {#expertise}

Users of this methodology are assumed to have solid understanding of how to evaluate web content using WCAG 2, accessible web design, assistive technologies, and of how people with different disabilities use the Web. This includes an understanding of web technologies; accessibility barriers that people with disabilities experience; assistive technologies and adaptive approaches that people with disabilities use; and evaluation techniques, tools, and methods to identify barriers for people with disabilities. In particular, it is assumed that users of this methodology are deeply familiar with all the resources listed in [Background Reading](#reading).

### Combined Expertise (Optional)

This methodology can be carried out by an individual evaluator with the skills described in the previous section ([Required Expertise](#expertise)), or a team of evaluators with collective expertise. Using the combined expertise of different evaluators may sometimes be necessary or beneficial when one evaluator alone does not possess all of the required expertise. [Using Combined Expertise to Evaluate Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/combined-expertise/) provides further guidance on using combined expertise of review teams, which is beyond the scope of this document.

### Involving Users (Optional)

Involving people with disabilities including people with aging-related impairments (who are not experienced evaluators or part of a review team) may help identify additional accessibility barriers that are not easily discovered by expert evaluation alone. While not required for using this methodology, it may sometimes be necessary for evaluators to involve real people with a wide range of abilities during the evaluation process. [Involving Users in Web Accessibility Evaluation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/involving-users/) provides further guidance on involving users in web accessibility evaluation, which is beyond the scope of this document.

### Evaluation Tools (Optional)

This methodology is independent of any particular web accessibility evaluation tool, web browser, and other software tool. While most accessibility checks are not fully automatable, evaluation tools can significantly assist evaluators during the evaluation process and contribute to more effective evaluation. For example, some web accessibility evaluation tools can scan entire digital product to help identify relevant pages for manual evaluation. Tools can also assist during manual (human) evaluation of accessibility checks. [Selecting Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/tools/selecting/) provides further guidance on using tools which is beyond the scope of this document.
