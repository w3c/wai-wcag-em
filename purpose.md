### Purposes for this Methodology

In many situations it is necessary to evaluate the accessibility of a digital product, for example before releasing, acquiring, or redesigning the product, and for periodic monitoring of the accessibility performance of a product over time.

*   Accessibility monitoring activities used to benchmark and to compare accessibility conformance over time.
*   Accessibility researchers and disability advocates who want to explore accessibility conformance practices.
