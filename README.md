# 2025 update for WCAG-EM

This repo contains drafts and explorations of a potential 2025 update of the 2014 [WCAG-EM](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG-EM/).

## Changelog

### Big picture

- Made methodology more widely applicable, by making it less specific, most notably by introducing the terms “digital products” (to refer to websites, apps, kiosks, documents) and “samples” (to refer to items selected for evaluation, like web pages, screens, pages, views).
- Removed all instances of WCAG 2.0 to be either WCAG 2 (where possible) or WCAG 2.2, so that it applies to the latest of WCAG 2.
- Simplified language where possible.
