### Terms and Definitions

For the purposes of this document, the following terms and definitions apply:

<dl>
<dt id="complete">Complete processes</dt>
<dd>From <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#cc3">WCAG 2.2 Conformance Requirement for Complete Processes</a>:<blockquote>  
When a Web page is one of a series of Web pages presenting a process (i.e., a sequence of steps that need to be completed in order to accomplish an activity), all Web pages in the process conform at the specified level or better. (Conformance is not possible at a particular level if any page in the process does not conform at that level or better.)</blockquote></dd>

<dt id="conformance">Conformance</dt>
<dd>From <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/#dfn-conform">WCAG 2.2 definition for "conformance"</a>:  
<blockquote>Satisfying all the requirements of a given standard, guideline or specification.</blockquote></dd>

<dt id="common">Common web pages</dt>
<dd>Web pages and <em>web page states</em> that are relevant to the entire website. This includes the homepage, login page, and other entry pages, and, where applicable, the sitemap, contacts page, site help, legal information, and similar web pages that are typically linked from all other web pages (usually from the header, footer, or navigation menu of a web page).

**Note:** A definition for [web page states](#states) is provided below.</dd>

<dt id="functionality">Essential functionality</dt>
<dd>Functionality of a website that, if removed, fundamentally changes the use or purpose of the website for users. This includes information that users of a website refer to and tasks that they carry out to perform this functionality.

**Note:** Examples of essential functionality include "selecting and purchasing a product from the shop area of the website", "completing and submitting a form provided on the website", and "registering for an account on the website".

**Note:** Other functionality is not excluded from the scope of evaluation. The term "essential functionality" is intended to help identify critical web pages and include them among others in an evaluation.</dd>

<dt id="evaluator">Evaluator</dt>
<dd>The person, team of people, organization, in-house department, or other entity responsible for carrying out the evaluation.</dd>

<dt id="commissioner">Evaluation commissioner</dt>
<dd>The person, team of people, organization, in-house department, or other entity that commissioned the evaluation.

**Note:** In many cases the evaluation commissioner may be the website owner or website developer, in other cases it may be another entity such as a procurer or an accessibility monitoring survey owner.</dd>

<dt id="relied">Relied upon (Technologies)</dt>

<dd>From <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-reliedupon">WCAG 2.2 definition for "relied upon"</a>:  
<blockquote>The content would not conform if that technology is turned off or is not supported.</blockquote></dd>

<dt id="sample">Sample</dt>

<dd>@@@</dd>

<dt id="template">Templates</dt>

<dd>From <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#def-Template">ATAG 2.0 definition for "templates"</a>:  
<blockquote>Content patterns that are filled in by authors or the authoring tool to produce web content for end users (e.g., document templates, content management templates, presentation themes). Often templates will pre-specify at least some authoring decisions.</blockquote></dd>

<dt id="website">Website</dt>
<dd>A coherent collection of one or more related web pages that together provide common use or functionality. It includes static web pages, dynamically generated web pages, and mobile websites and applications.

**Note:** The focus of this methodology is on full, self-enclosed websites. Websites may be composed of smaller sub-sites, each of which can be considered to be an individual website. For example, a website may include an online shop, an area for each department within the organization, a blog area, and other areas that may each be considered to be a website.</dd>

<dt id="developer">Website developer</dt>
<dd>The person, team of people, organization, in-house department, or other entity that is involved in the website development process including but not limited to content authors, designers, front-end developers, back-end programmers, quality assurance testers, and project managers.</dd>

<dt id="owner">Website owner</dt>
<dd>The person, team of people, organization, in-house department, or other entity that is responsible for the website.</dd>

<dt id="webpage">Web page</dt>
<dd>From <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-webpage">WCAG 2.2 definition for "web page"</a>:  
<blockquote>A non-embedded resource obtained from a single URI using HTTP plus any other resources that are used in the rendering or intended to be rendered together with it by a user agent.</blockquote>

**Note:** Web pages may include multimedia content, interactive components, and rich and mobile web applications. Web pages are not limited to HTML and can be PDF documents and any other format.</dd>

<dt id="states">Web page states</dt>
<dd>Dynamically generated web pages sometimes provide significantly different content, functionality, and appearance depending on the user, interaction, device, and other parameters. In the context of this methodology such web page states can be treated as ancillary to web pages (recorded as an additional state of a web page in a web page sample) or as individual web pages.

**Note:** Examples of web page states are the individual pages of a multi-part online form that are dynamically generated depending on the user's input. These individual states may not have unique URIs and may need to be identified by describing the settings, input, and actions required to generate them.</dd>
