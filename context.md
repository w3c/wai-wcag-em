### Relation to WCAG 2 Conformance Claims

WCAG 2.2 defines [conformance requirements](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#conformance-reqs) for individual web pages (and in some cases, sets of web pages), but does not describe how to evaluate entire websites. It also defines how to make optional [conformance claims](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#conformance-claims) to cover individual web pages, a series of web pages such as a multi-page form, and multiple related web pages such as a website. This applies when all web pages that are in the scope of a conformance claim have each been evaluated or created in a process that ensures that they each satisfy all the conformance requirements.

**WCAG 2 conformance claims cannot be made for entire websites based upon the evaluation of a selected sub-set of web pages and functionality alone**, as it is always possible that there will be unidentified conformance errors on these websites. However, in the majority of uses of this methodology only a sample of web pages and functionality from a website is selected for evaluation. Thus in the majority of situations, **using this methodology alone does not result in WCAG 2 conformance claims** for the target websites. Guidance on making statements about the outcomes from using this methodology is provided in [Step 5.c: Provide an Evaluation Statement (Optional)](#step5c).
