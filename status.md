This document builds on WCAG-EM 1.0, which was developed by the [WCAG 2.0 Evaluation Methodology (Eval) Task Force](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/2011/eval/eval-tf), a joint task force of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Working Group (now renamed [Accessibility Guidelines (AG) Working Group](https://www.w3.org/WAI/about/groups/agwg/) and [Evaluation and Repair Tools (ERT) Working Group](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/). It provides informative guidance on evaluation in accordance with [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag).

In the review of this draft, we are looking to find out if:

1. are all digital products that real evaluators commonly evaluate (because of regulation or otherwise) covered, in the sense that they are not explicitly excluded? 
2. does terminology of 'sample set' and 'sample' match how evaluators use it in their evaluations?
3. is this new version more useful for evaluators when they evaluate apps, given that there are legal requirements for apps in addition to websites some jurisdictions?
